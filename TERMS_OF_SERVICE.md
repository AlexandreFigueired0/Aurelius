BY INVITING OR USING THE BOT YOU REPRESENT THAT YOU HAVE AUTHORITY TO BIND THE DISCORD SERVER ("SERVER") WHERE IT IS INSTALLED AND YOU AGREE TO BE LEGALLY BOUND BY THESE TERMS. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE, DO NOT USE THE BOT AND REMOVE IT IMMEDIATELY.

You also agree to be bound by: (a) Discord's Terms of Service and Community Guidelines; and (b) any posted usage instructions or policies referenced herein (collectively, the "Agreement").

## 2. Description of the Service
The Bot provides automated functionality including, without limitation: market or pricing data retrieval, charts, watchlists, stock/asset alerts, and related informational outputs derived from third‑party data sources (e.g., public market data APIs such as Yahoo Finance via yfinance).

## 3. Eligibility & Authority
You must (a) have a Discord account in good standing, (b) have authority (where applicable) to administer or manage the Server, and (c) be of legal age of majority in your jurisdiction. If you invite the Bot to a Server, you represent you have obtained any required permissions from the Server owner(s).

## 4. NO INVESTMENT / FINANCIAL / LEGAL / TAX ADVICE
ALL CONTENT PROVIDED BY THE BOT IS FOR GENERAL INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. IT DOES NOT CONSTITUTE OR CONVEY (AND YOU AGREE NOT TO RELY UPON IT AS) INVESTMENT, TRADING, FINANCIAL, LEGAL, OR TAX ADVICE, RECOMMENDATIONS, ENDORSEMENTS, OR STRATEGIES. YOU ALONE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR TRADING OR INVESTMENT DECISIONS. PAST PERFORMANCE DOES NOT GUARANTEE FUTURE RESULTS. YOU ASSUME ALL RISK OF LOSS OR DAMAGE RESULTING FROM YOUR USE OR RELIANCE ON ANY BOT OUTPUT.

## 5. Third‑Party Data, Services, & Integrations
5.1 Data may be delayed, incomplete, inaccurate, disrupted, or become unavailable without notice.  
5.2 We do not guarantee real‑time accuracy, timeliness, suitability, or reliability of any market, price, news, or other data.  
5.3 Third‑party APIs or providers may impose rate limits, licensing terms, or outages which can impact functionality.  
5.4 You acknowledge that all third‑party content is provided AS IS and is subject to each provider's own terms.  
5.5 We do not endorse or assume responsibility for any third‑party sites, services, or data.

## 6. Acceptable Use & Prohibited Conduct
You agree NOT to (and NOT to permit or facilitate any third party to):  
(a) use the Bot in violation of law, regulation, sanctions, or export controls;  
(b) attempt to circumvent technical limitations, security controls, rate limits, or data access restrictions;  
(c) scrape, harvest, bulk‑download, or systematically archive output beyond ordinary Server usage;  
(d) reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or derive source code (except to the limited extent permitted by open‑source license terms expressly applicable to portions of the codebase);

## 8. Modifications; Suspension; Discontinuation
We may (a) modify features, (b) deploy updates, (c) suspend or throttle functionality, or (d) discontinue the Bot, in whole or in part, at any time with or without notice. We are not liable for any resulting loss, including loss of data, profits, goodwill, or expected savings.

## 9. Open‑Source Components & Licenses
Portions of the Bot may rely on third‑party, open‑source libraries or APIs subject to their own licenses. To the extent required, such licenses are incorporated by reference and prevail solely with respect to their governed components if these Terms conflict.

## 10. Intellectual Property
Except for third‑party data and components, all rights, title, and interest in and to the Bot (including code, compilations, trademarks, service marks, logos, and branding) are owned by Us or our licensors. No rights are granted except as expressly stated. You may not use our marks without prior written permission.

## 11. Feedback
Any ideas, suggestions, enhancements, bug reports, or feedback you provide ("Feedback") are voluntary and may be used, adapted, published, or otherwise exploited by Us without restriction or compensation. Feedback is not confidential.

## 12. Data & Privacy
Your use is also governed by the then‑current Privacy Policy (incorporated by reference).

You represent you have provided any notices and obtained any consents required under applicable data protection laws for our processing of Server‑related data.

## 13. Security
We implement reasonable technical and organizational measures; however, NO SYSTEM IS 100% SECURE. You acknowledge that residual risk (including unauthorized access, disclosure, or corruption) may occur and you assume such risk to the maximum extent permitted by law.

## 14. Disclaimers of Warranties
TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE BOT (INCLUDING ALL DATA, OUTPUT, CONTENT, AND FEATURES) IS PROVIDED "AS IS," "AS AVAILABLE," AND WITH ALL FAULTS. WE AND OUR LICENSORS EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF ACCURACY, TITLE, NON‑INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, QUIET ENJOYMENT, OR ARISING FROM COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE.

WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, OUR TOTAL AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE BOT OR THESE TERMS WILL NOT EXCEED (A) USD $10 OR (B) THE AMOUNTS (IF ANY) YOU ACTUALLY PAID US FOR PREMIUM ACCESS DURING THE THREE (3) MONTHS IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE FIRST EVENT GIVING RISE TO LIABILITY—WHICHEVER IS GREATER. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY; IN SUCH CASES THE ABOVE LIMITATION WILL APPLY TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED.

## 16. Assumption of Risk; No Fiduciary Duty
YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT MARKET DATA IS VOLATILE AND THAT AUTOMATED OUTPUT MAY BE INCOMPLETE OR MISLEADING. YOU VOLUNTARILY ASSUME ALL RISKS OF USE. NO FIDUCIARY, CLIENT, PARTNERSHIP, OR AGENCY RELATIONSHIP IS CREATED BY THESE TERMS OR YOUR USE OF THE BOT.

## 17. Indemnification
You will defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Us and our affiliates, contributors, and service providers from and against any and all claims, demands, losses, damages, liabilities, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of or related to: (a) Your use or misuse of the Bot; (b) violation of these Terms; (c) violation of law or third‑party rights; or (d) content or data processed via Your Server(s). We may (at our option) assume control of the defense; You remain responsible for associated costs.

## 18. Term; Termination; Survival
These Terms become effective upon first use and continue until terminated. We may terminate or suspend access (in whole or part) at any time, with or without cause. Upon termination: (a) stop all use and remove the Bot; (b) Sections 4, 5, 6, 8, 9–19 survive.

## 19. Changes to Terms
We may update these Terms by posting a revised version (with a new Effective Date). Changes take effect upon posting unless otherwise stated. Continued use after the Effective Date constitutes acceptance. Material changes may be signaled via repository notice or release notes.

## 20. Export & Sanctions Compliance
You represent that you are not located in, under the control of, or a national or resident of any restricted jurisdiction or on any restricted list (including OFAC, EU, UK, or UN sanctions lists). You will not export or re‑export the Bot in violation of applicable export laws.

## 21. Governing Law; Venue
Unless required otherwise by a mandatory law, this Agreement is governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of: [Insert Governing Law Jurisdiction] (excluding conflict of laws rules). You consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of courts located in [Insert Venue], for any dispute not subject to arbitration (if arbitration clause is adopted) and waive objections to venue or forum.

## 22. Severability
If any provision is held unenforceable, it will be modified to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable; the remainder stays in full force.

## 23. Entire Agreement; Non‑Assignment
These Terms (including referenced policies) are the entire agreement. You may not assign or transfer them without prior written consent. We may assign to a successor or affiliate. Any prohibited assignment is void.

## 24. Waiver
No waiver of any provision is effective unless in writing. Failure to enforce any provision is not a waiver.

## 25. Force Majeure

## 26. Notices & Contact
