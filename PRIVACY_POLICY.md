# Aurelius — Privacy Policy

1) Summary
- We collect minimal data needed to operate the Bot, deliver alerts, and improve reliability. We do not sell your personal information.

2) Data We Collect
- Discord server metadata: server ID and server name.
- Alert settings: watched tickers, thresholds, alert status, and timestamps.
- Transient command data: message content and user identifiers are processed only to perform commands; we do not store them in our database.
- Technical logs: runtime and error logs may include timestamps, server/guild IDs, channel IDs, and command usage necessary for diagnostics.

3) How We Use Data
- Operate core features (stock lookups, charts, news, alerts).
- Maintain subscriptions and thresholds per server.
- Ensure security, prevent abuse, and debug issues.
- Comply with legal obligations if required.

4) Legal Bases (EEA/UK where applicable)
- Performance of a contract (providing the Bot).
- Legitimate interests (security, debugging, preventing abuse).
- Consent where required by law.

5) Sharing and Disclosure
- Service providers: hosting, database, and logging providers that process data on our behalf under appropriate safeguards.
- Third‑party content sources: we request market/news data from providers (e.g., Yahoo Finance) but do not share your server data with them beyond routine network metadata.
- Legal: we may disclose data if required by law or to protect rights, safety, and integrity.

6) Data Retention
- Server and subscription data are kept while the Bot remains in your server and as needed to operate the service.
- Logs are retained for a limited period and then overwritten or deleted.
- Upon valid deletion requests, we delete associated server data unless retention is required by law or for security.

7) Security
- We use reasonable administrative and technical safeguards. No method is 100% secure.

8) Your Choices and Rights
- Remove the Bot from your server to stop future collection.
- Manage subscriptions with in‑Bot commands (e.g., unwatch).
- Server owners/admins may request access, correction, or deletion of server data by contacting us with the server ID.
- EEA/UK/other regions: you may have rights to access, rectify, erase, restrict, or object to processing, and data portability.

9) Children
- The Bot is intended for users who meet Discord’s minimum age requirements. We do not knowingly collect data from children under those ages.

10) International Transfers
- Data may be processed in countries other than your own. We use safeguards where required by law.

11) Changes to This Policy
- We may update this Policy. Continued use after changes means you accept the updated Policy.
